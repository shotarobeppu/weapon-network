# Overview

1. The effect of weapons on conflicts
2. IV approach
3. Model of supply and demand

# Background

## Facts

1. Conflicts are ending 

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/images/start_end_year.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../output/images/start_end_year_region.png")
```

## Facts 

2. Less deadly?

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", fig.align='center', comment= "UCDP/PRIO 21.1"}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../output/images/death_yearly.png",
                        "../output/images/intensity_yearly.png"))
```

## Facts

3. More weapons.[^1]

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', comment= "UCDP/PRIO 21.1"}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/images/export_yearly.png")
```

[^1]: SALW for \emph{Small Arms and Light Weapons}

## Question

- The effect of weapons on ongoing conflicts.

  - Worsen Conflict?
  - Deterrence?
  
## Hypothesis

- Additional supply of weapons worsens conflicts.

# Empirical test

## Why IV

1. Increase in weapons affects conflicts.
2. More intense conflicts increase demands for weapons.
3. Confounding variables such as hatred.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', comment= "UCDP/PRIO 21.1"}
knitr::include_graphics("../presentation/images/iv_dag.png")
```

## IV

Use end of conflicts in other region as an IV.

## Logic

1. Conflict ends in country A.
$\rightarrow$ Demand for weapons in A goes close to 0 (Assumption). 
2. Market of weapon reacts.
$\rightarrow$ Price of weapon goes down.
3. Other buyers in country B can buy more.
4. Suppliers provide more weapons to those buyers.
5. There will be more weapons in country B.

## Exclusion Restriction 

Africa's timing of end of war would not affect India's war other than changes in the weapon market.

1. Migration, Services etc.

2. Peace building activities? Other trade?

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', comment= "UCDP/PRIO 21.1"}
knitr::include_graphics("../presentation/images/iv_dag_er.png")
```

## Data

1. [\textcolor{blue}{UCDP/PRIO}](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/) (Conflict)
2. [\textcolor{blue}{US COMTRADE}](https://comtrade.un.org/data/Doc/api/ex/r) (Trade)

3. Problem: Only USD. Cannot distinguish between price $\downarrow$ and quantity $\uparrow$.

# Model

## Fixed Network - Setup

- Two suppliers (s1 & s2) and Three buyers (b1, b2 & b3)
- Assumptions
  - Entire network is common knowledge
  
  - Compete on quantity

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', comment= "UCDP/PRIO 21.1"}
knitr::include_graphics("../presentation/images/example_network.png")
```

## Fixed Network - Setup

Firm's profit is 
\begin{align}
    \pi_s(a) &= \sum_{b \in \bm{B}} g_{s,b}P(q_b)q_{s,b} - C_s(a) \\
    P_b(q_b) &= \alpha - \beta q_b \\
    C_s(a) &= c q_s^2
\end{align}

where $a = (q_{s,b1}, q_{s,b2}, q_{s,b3})$, $B = \{b1, b2, b3\}$, $g_{s,b} = \{0,1\}$, $q_b = q_{s1,b} + q_{s2,b}$, and $q_s = q_{s,b1} + q_{s,b2} + q_{s,b3}$.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="70%", fig.align='center', }
knitr::include_graphics("../presentation/images/example_network.png")
```

## Fixed Network - Change of environment

\begin{align}
    q_{s_1,b_2} = q_{s_2,b_2} &= \frac{\alpha}{5c+3\beta} \\
    q_{s_1,b_2}' &= \frac{\alpha}{8c+3\beta} \\
    q_{s_2,b_2}' &= \frac{\alpha\beta + 4\alpha c}{3\beta^2 + 8c^2 + 11\beta c}
\end{align}

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", fig.align='center', fig.subcap= c('before', 'after')}
knitr::include_graphics(c("../presentation/images/example_network.png",
                          "../presentation/images/example_network_2.png"))
```

## Fixed Network - Result (potential)

1. If number of buyers decreases, supplier will supply more to existing buyers
2. The difference will be stronger for those that were linked by suppliers before.

## $g_{s,b}?$

For fixed network, similar to gravity model

\begin{equation}
  \frac{Arms Industry_s * Battle Intensity_b}{Distance_{s,b}*Preference_{s,b}}
\end{equation}

## Refinement

1. New matching depends on which conflict ended. 
2. Conflict environment $\rightarrow$ @RefWorks:RefID:63-franke2015conflict, @konig2017networks
3. Incomplete information $\rightarrow$ Bargaining? Search Theory? @RefWorks:RefID:839-peters1994equilibrium

## Refinement (idea)

1. Buyers optimize their quantity based on its conflict and expected linkage to suppliers.
\begin{align}
  \pi_b &= \sum_{j \in \mathbf{B}/\{i\}} p_{ij}V - \sum_{j \in \mathbf{B}/\{i\}} p_{ji}V - C(a) \\
  p_{ij} &= \frac{q_i}{q_i + q_j}
\end{align}

2. Suppliers have preferences based on friendship, distance etc. (this preference list will change after the end of some conflict)

3. Buyers who many suppliers have high preference can demand the price to go down. (proportional to degree of buyer?)

4. Trading is complete and buyers get payoff.
